five units

Unit 1: random access: The focus of this first unit is on the ways artists have used games and game-like devices (like for instance, chance operations) to breathe new life into their artistic processes.  Some of these games are played by artists with themselves, some of them are played by artists on their audiences and some of them are designed by artists for their audience to play.   


Unit 2: possible worlds : The focus of this second unit is on the play ground, the alternative reality where ordinary actions become play, what Jan Huizinga refers to as the "Magic Circle".  We will be thinking about how these spaces are constructed and looking at how artists have created and used these spaces.  



Unit 3 playerz, haterz: In this unit we'll be considering how the identity of a game character is constructed, and how that identity interacts with and expands the identity of the person playing the game.  We'll look at avatars, costume conferences




unit 4 systems: In this fourth unit we turn our attention to systems.
