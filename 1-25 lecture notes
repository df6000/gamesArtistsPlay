conspiracy theories are kind of similar to games -- where you decide on this new arbotrary set of rules.

and part of that process is deciding, ok, a dice roll of six = you're dead.  for no reason really other than that's the rules.

or for instance you decide to call a flashlight a lightsaber.

this is kind of like how variables work btw, in that you decide you will have this arbitrary name and you just arbitrarily decide to let it be the equal to something.
